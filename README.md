Here is a AirBnb price prediciton project that I did along with some of my classmates, this was a very enjoyable project that we did based of the AirBnb NYC data from 2019 and 2023. 
Our professor asked us to add an some extra variables for comparsion so we also included data from AirBnb across the United States, so we also did some comparsions from US Airbnb's from 2020 and 2023
